# Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between student performance and mental health by integrating and exploring two distinct datasets: one focused on student depression and another on academic performance. Using data science techniques, we seek to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential predictive insights to help institutions better support students struggling with academic and mental health challenges. The project will involve data integration, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Research Questions
1. What are the key academic and lifestyle factors that correlate with student depression?
2. Can we build a predictive model to identify students at risk of depression based on academic and lifestyle factors?
3. How does academic performance, including attendance, midterm and final exam scores, and study habits, impact student mental health outcomes?
4. What role do external factors such as financial stress and family history of mental illness play in predicting depression risk among students?

## Team
**Shivali Patel (Individual Project)**

## Datasets
### 1. Student Depression Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Format**: CSV
- **Original Source**: [Include Original Data Source URL]
- **Description**: Contains demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors related to student mental health.
- **Key Features**:
  - Demographics: Age, gender, city
  - Academic Indicators: CGPA, academic pressure, study satisfaction
  - Lifestyle & Wellbeing: Sleep duration, dietary habits, work pressure, study hours
  - Mental Health Factors: Depression status (target variable), financial stress, family history of mental illness
- **Challenges**: Ethical concerns, missing data, and class imbalance in depression status labels.

### 2. Student Performance & Behavior Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Format**: JSON
- **Original Source**: [Include Original Data Source URL]
- **Description**: Contains detailed academic performance records, behavior metrics, and stress indicators for students.
- **Key Features**:
  - Academic Performance: Midterm score, final score, assignments average, participation score, projects score, total grade
  - Study Behavior: Attendance, study hours per week, extracurricular activities
  - Stress & Wellbeing: Self-reported stress levels (1-10), sleep hours per night, internet access at home
  - Family Background: Parent education level, family income level
- **Challenges**: Missing values in some records, grading bias, and imbalanced distributions across departments.

## Implementation Plan 
### Data Acquisition & Integration
- Convert JSON dataset into a structured format.
- Merge datasets on common identifiers where applicable.
- Ensure data integrity with checksums.

### Data Profiling & Quality Assessment
- Identify missing values and biases.
- Conduct summary statistics and distribution analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
- Generate visualizations for correlations between academic performance and depression risk.
- Identify key patterns in stress levels, study habits, and performance metrics.

### Model Development
- Train a classification model to predict depression risk.
- Test different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

### Reproducibility & Documentation
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for code execution.
- Store project in a GitHub repository with structured Markdown documentation.
- Automate dataset retrieval and cleaning scripts.

### Final Report & Submission
- Summarize findings and insights in Markdown format.
- Ensure all documentation and metadata are complete.
- Create a GitHub release for the final project submission.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy & Anonymization**: Ensure that any sensitive information is handled responsibly.
- **Bias & Fairness**: Account for potential biases in the dataset that may skew predictions.
- **Reproducibility & Transparency**: Clearly document all processing steps and maintain a transparent workflow.

By following this structured plan, the project will effectively explore the relationship between academic performance and mental health, providing meaningful insights while ensuring reproducibility and ethical data handling.
